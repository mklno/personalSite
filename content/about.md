I am Manoprasanth MATHAVAN, who hail from a little coastal town named [*Pondicherry*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pondicherry) situtated on the South Indian peninsula. I am an Engineer by profession. I have a great zeal towards fabricating ideas, research, learn and experiment. *Kafkaa* is one such experiment as well. 

The primary motive behind this experiment is to build *Kafkaa* as a [*Digital Garden*](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/). The concept of a digital garden doesn't really rely on any particular ethos, in short its less about connection and feedback and more about building a quiet space that we can call ours.  

The onset of social media might have had good notions behind it. But today, its not the case so. To be honest, it had caused [more harm](https://margiolis.net/w/socialmedia/) than any good. 

<blockquote>
This is the secret of propaganda: Those who are to be persuaded by it should be completely immersed in the ideas of the propaganda, without ever noticing that they are being immersed in it.

Propaganda works best when those who are being manipulated are confident they are acting on their own free will.

-- Joseph GÃ¶bbels

As we are in the Information Age, where we don't just face information overload but also opinion overload, Kafkaa is a place I strive to live away from all the cacophony of the mainstream Internet.
